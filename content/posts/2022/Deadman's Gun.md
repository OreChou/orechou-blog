成长道路是比较痛苦的，从青年一路走过来，自己的棱角被磨圆，没有了以往的神气。
往往在深夜的时候，想起曾经那些喜欢的英雄，都已过去，都已逝去。
而我才后知后觉，忘了告别。

歌曲 Deadman's Gun 的 [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yag41F7eCLU) 地址。
歌词如下：
```
Your hands upon
A deadman's gun, and you're
Lookin' down the sights

Your heart is warm
And the seams are torn, and they've
Given you a reason to fight

And you're not gonna take
What they've got to give
And you're not gonna let 'em take your will to live
Because they've taken enough
And you've given them all you can give
And luck won't save them tonight
They've given you a reason to fight

And all the storms you've been chasin'
About to rain down tonight
And all that pain you've been facin'
About to come into the light

Your hands upon
A deadman's gun, and you're
Lookin' down the sights

Your heart is warm
And the seams are torn, and they've
Given you a reason to fight

And you're not gonna take
What they've got to give
And you're not gonna let 'em take your will to live
Because they've taken enough
And you've given them all you can give
And luck won't save them tonight
They've given you a reason to fight

And all the storms you've been chasin'
About to rain down tonight
And all that pain you've been facin'
About to come into the light
```

歌曲 That's The Way It Is 的 [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjYLY3BGDY4) 地址。
歌词如下：
```
[Verse 1]
The many miles we walked
The many things we learned
The building of a shrine
Only just to burn
May the wind be at your back
Good fortune touch your hand
May the cards lay out a straight
All from your command

[Chorus]
That's the way it is
That’s the way it is
That's the way it is
That's the way it is

[Verse 2]
Blue heron leaves the northern sky
Trusts the journey to new heights
What’s the meaning of the scar
If we don't know how to heal
Should we ever be apart
Then how does it feel

[Chorus]
That's the way it is
That's the way it is
That's the way it is
That's the way it is

[Bridge]
Shine light into darkness
Shine light into darkness

[Chorus]
That's the way it is
That's the way it is (So many miles to walk)
That’s the way it is (So many things we’ve got to learn)
That's the way it is (Oh, that’s the way it is)
That's the way it is (Oh)
That's the way it is
